# python-test-authentise

This repo contains tasks 1-4 in one .py file, which can be run as a console application.
The earlier commits are for tasks 1-3 .

There is no special configuration that needs to be done to run these and for task #4 the file does not need to be in a specific place.
However the full file path must be passed in and the file must be a .txt
